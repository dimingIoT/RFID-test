## <a name="1"></a>Overview of CS463 IoT Stack 

CS463 has a rich set of hardware peripherals for users to have access to various sensors and networks (e.g. UHF RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RS-232, USB, etc.)

Developers can run the CS463 reader as a Linux edge device and develop their own application on the reader, using various development framework and software libraries including:

* C# (Mono Runtime 6 or .NET Framework 4.7 compatible)
* Java (JRE 1.8)
* Javascript (Node.js v12 with NPM)
* Python (Python 3 with PIP)
* Version Control (Git)
* Visual Programming (Node-Red)
* MQTT Messaging (Eclipse Mosiqutto)
* Local storage (SQLite)

![iot stack](../img/cs463-iot-stack.png)

All these can be installed as DNF packages via the CS463 repository.  We assume your reader has reference to the repository on the preivous edge device configurations.

For this post, we are going to install Node.js and create a web server app on the reader with Javascript so that you can receive tag data from the CS463 event engine.

After that, we will install Node-Red, a visual programming tool based on Node.js on the reader.  It will further simplify the development process.

## <a name="2"></a> Install Node.js from the Repository

Install Node.js on your reader with the following command on Linux terminal:

`sudo dnf install node`

Please acknowledge the installation so that Node.js will be installed to your reader.

```

## <a name="3"></a> Create a Test Application with Node.js 

You can create a web server application with Node.js to receive tag data from the CS463 event engine.

* Go you your home directory (`/home/cslrfid` in this case) and create the folder `nodejsTestApp`
* Within the folder, create and edit the file using editor `nano server.js` with nano editor
* Paste the code below for creating a web server on the reader to receive http post request at port 3000

```
const http = require("http");

const hostname = "0.0.0.0";
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(`\n${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  console.log(req.headers);

  req.on("data", function(chunk) {
    console.log("BODY: " + chunk);
  });

  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  res.end("Hello World\n");
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

* At the terminal, run `node server.js` to start the Node.js app.
* Log into the CS463 web interface.  To go `Network -> Cloud Server -> List Cloud Server`.  Select the cloud server that is currently active.
* Change the path to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` so that all tag data will be redirected to the local Node.js app. 

![csl cloud server localhost](../img/cs463-cloud-server-localhost.png)

* Back to the terminal with the app running, you should see tag data being returned as http post request.

## <a name="4"></a> Remote Debugging with Visual Studio Code

For larger-scale development, you might want to have the development environment on your computer and develop, compile and deploy the code to the reader and debug the code remotely.  You can do that with Visual Studio Code via remote debugging.  VS Code is a cross-platform tool that is avaiable for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

1. Download [VS Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) for free and install on your computer
2. Map the working folder on the reader to your computer using sshfs.  In our case, we are mapping the folder `/home/cslrfid/nodejsTestApp` to our local folder in the same name under our home directory.

```
sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions cslrfid@cs463-7b8400f6.local:/home/cslrfid/nodejsTestApp ~/nodejsTestApp/
```
3. Launch VS Code and go to `File -> Open...`.  Select the folder being mapped above
4. You can now see the files on your reader on VS Code
5. Select the Debug tab and click on the "gear" icon to create a new launch.json file.  Select "node" as your language
6. On the launch.json file being generated, add the following configuration for remote debugging.  Fill in the hostname/IP address of your reader.
![vscode launch.json](../img/cs463-nodejs-vscode-launchjson.png)
7. On the VS Code terminal, ssh into the reader and run your app on the reader with the following command:
```
node —inspect-blk=cs463-7b8400f6.local:9229 server.js
```
8. You can now select the `Attach to remote` configuration on VS Code to start debugging.  The VS Code debugger will be attached to the app running on the reader remotely.  You can put in breakpoint to at the lines that you would like.

## <a name="6"></a> Create System Service to Start Node-Red on Start

After Node-Red is installed, you can create a service to run Node-Red on start

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node-red.service
```

Add the following content to the file.  For the option `--inspect=cs463-7b8400f6.local:9229`, please change the hostname to the hostname/IP address of your reader.  This option can be removed if debugging with Chrome browser is not needed.

## <a name="7"></a> Enable Password Authentication on Node-Red

By default, Node-Red editor is fully opened.  You can enable password authenticate to the editor:

- Stop Node-Red service.

```
sudo systemctl stop node-red
```


- Install Node-Red admin module.

```
sudo npm install -g node-red-admin
```
- Hash you password with `node-red-admin hash-pw`.  Enter the password you would like to set and obtain an hashed value.

```
cs463-7b8400f6:~/.node-red$ node-red-admin hash-pw
Password: 
$2a$08$9zrsysmnmejJ4K39mOBpzerIxyxWh.lvGSDFglGi9xi.akZS9ScDa
cs463-7b8400f6:~/.node-red$ 

```
- Enable password authentication on Node-Red by editing the settings.js file `nano ~/.node-red/settings.js`.  Replace the password with the hashed value being generated.

``` 
adminAuth: {
        type: "credentials",
        users: [{
            username: "admin",
            password: "$2a$08$9zrsysmnmejJ4K39mOBpzerIxyxWh.lvGSDFglGi9xi.akZS9ScDa",
            permissions: "*"
        }]
    },
```
- Start the Node-Red service again.

```
sudo systemctl start node-red
```

If you open the Node-Red URL again, you should see authentication will be required.

![nodered login](../img/cs463-nodered-login.png)

## <a name="8"></a> Debug Javascript Function Node in Chrome Browser

Node-Red is built on Node.js so you can do debugging on function node also.

Let say if you have a function node with some Javascript code inside.  You can insert the `debugger` statement into the code as breakpoint so that Chrome can attach to the target app and break at the specific point.

- Launch the Node-Red editor.
- Insert `debugger` statements into you Javascript code as breakpoints.

![nodered debugger](../img/cs463-nodered-debugger.png)

- Launch a new Chrome window and type in `chrome://inspect` on the URL.  Identify your reader on the list and click on inspect

![chrome inspect](./img/cs463-chrome-inspect.png)

- A dediated debugger window will be launched.  The flow will continue to execute until you hit the debugger statement within the flow, where the app will halt.

## <a name="9"></a> Install Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT Broker on the Reader

Node-Red provide native support to MQTT, where you can subscribe/publish to specific topics on a remote broker.  In case if you would like to use CS463 as a MQTT broker for consolidating and processing various sensor data, you can install Eclipse Mosquitto broker on the reader.

- Install package from the repository with `sudo dnf install mosquitto`:

```

## <a name="10"></a> Redirect Tag Data to MQTT Broker on Node-Red

By using Node-Red, you can easily create a flow for sending the tag data from the event engine to a local/remote MQTT broker.  Here are the steps required:

* Create a 4 node flow:
	* `http in` node to accept http post request from the event engine at the URL /SendTags
	* `http response` node for reporting the http responses
	* `mqtt out` node for publishing the JSON data to the topic `/message/events` on the local Mosquitto

On your computer, you can also run a MQTT client and observe the tag data being published:

![mqtt client](../img/cs463-mqtt-client.png)

The following is the flow that you can import into Node-Red:

```
