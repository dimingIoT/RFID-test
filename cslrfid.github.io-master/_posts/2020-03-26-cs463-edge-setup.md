**Objectives:** 

* To prepare your edge device for hosting custom applications 
* To perform configurations on Linux operating system through SSH terminal
* Enable installation of additonal packages to the reader with Linux package manager
* To enable security on the reader


**Technical Level:** Intermediate/Advanced 

**Prerequisits:**

* CS463 basic operations
* CS463 access mode and event engine
* Basic knowledge of Linux terminal and commands

> Note: We strongly recommended to review the the following information before proceeding to the steps as all users have full access to the device by default.  Make sure you know what you are doing.

**Recipe:**

1. [SSH Access with Root Account and Password](#1)
2. [Change Root Account Password](#2)
3. [Add User Account](#3)
4. [Add Package Repository to the Reader](#4)
5. [Create Self-Signed Certificate and enable TLS v1.2 Access to the Reader](#5)


## <a name="1"></a>SSH Access with Root Account and Password

You can perform SSH access to the reader with your root account and default password:

```
Username: root
Password: cs463
```

You can SSH with the reader IP adress or the hostname of the reader.  Hostname can either be captured ont he stastus page of the web interface, or it follows the convention of `cs463-` plus the last eight digits of the Ethernet MAC address (written on the device label) along with `.local` to represent a local device.  In this case, the hostname of the reader is `cs463-7b8400f6`

```
> ssh root@cs463-7b8400f6.local
root@cs463-7b8400f6.local's password:

CSL Reader, Linux 4.14.78,  Java 1.8.0_221,   2020 February 13

U Boot	2020 January 21
Kernel	2019 July 29
DTB	2020 January 20
Rootfs	2020 February 13



root@cs463-7b8400f6:~#    

```

## <a name="2"></a>Change Root Account Password

Once you have access to the terminal, you can change the default password of the root account:

```
root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# passwd
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# 
```
> Note: It is recommended to create another user account for general account

 
## <a name="3"></a>Add User Account 

To create a user account for general access (`cslrfid` in this case):

```
root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# adduser cslrfid
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully

root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# 
```

Then add the user to the wheel group, which gives it sudo privileges. 

```
root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# gpasswd -a cslrfid wheel
Adding user cslrfid to group wheel

root@cs463-7b8400f6:~# 
```

If adding the user to the group does not work immediately, you may have to edit the /etc/sudoers file with `nano /etc/sudoers` to uncomment the line with the group name:

```
...
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
...
```

You will need to logout as root and log back in with the new account for changes to take effect.

## <a name="4"></a>Add Package Repository to the Reader

CSL is hosting a package repository server for installing RPM packages for having extended features on the reader.  All of these packages are open source under MIT licensing.

In order to download packages, you need to make referece to the repository by adding the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/csl-remote-repo.repo` using the command:

```
cs463-7b8400f6:~$ sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/csl-remote-repo.repo
```
In the editor, paste the following information and save the file.

```
[cslrepo]
name=CSL Intelligent Reader Repository
baseurl=http://repos01.convergence.com.hk/repo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```
Update the repository by using the command `dnf -v repolist all`:

```
cs463-7b8400f6:~$ dnf -v repolist all
